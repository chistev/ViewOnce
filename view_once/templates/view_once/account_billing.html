        <h3>1. Creating an Account</h3>
        <p>
            To use ViewOnce, you need to create an account. Visit the <a href="{% url 'login' %}">login page</a> and click "Create an account" to sign up. Youâ€™ll provide an email address and password, which are encrypted for security. Your account allows you to generate secure one-time links and access the <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">dashboard</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Managing Your Account</h3>
        <p>
            You can manage your account settings directly from the dashboard:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Update Profile</strong>: Change your email or password in the "Settings" section of the <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">dashboard</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion</strong>: Request deletion of your account and associated metadata (e.g., usage logs, subscription info) by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@viewonce.com">privacy@viewonce.com</a>. Note that messages and files are automatically deleted after access or expiration and cannot be recovered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
