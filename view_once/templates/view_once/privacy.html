    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how ViewOnce collects, uses, and protects your
        information when you use our services.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Account & Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                ViewOnce requires users to create an account to access the platform. During registration, we collect
                limited personal information such as your email address and password. This data is used solely to
                authenticate users, monitor usage limits, and support our monetization features. We do not sell or share
                this information with third parties.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Purposeful Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                We only collect information essential for operating the service â€” such as usage analytics, login data,
                and link creation statistics. We do not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising tools. No
                personally identifying information is stored unless explicitly provided (e.g., through support requests
                or billing).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>End-to-End Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                All files and messages sent through ViewOnce are encrypted in transit and at rest. We cannot read the
                contents of your messages or files. Content is deleted automatically after the one-time link is accessed
                or the set expiration time is reached.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Link Anonymity</h3>
            <p>
                ViewOnce is designed to prevent link recipients from identifying the sender. One-time links are
                unlinkable and are destroyed upon use, ensuring maximum privacy and anonymity.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>
                ViewOnce is hosted on secure infrastructure and does not rely on third-party services for file or
                message storage. All content is stored and managed directly on our platform. We may use trusted
                third-party tools only for specific features like payment processing or support, and those services are
                selected based on their compliance with strong privacy and security standards.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
                ViewOnce only retains user data for as long as necessary to deliver services and comply with legal
                obligations. All content shared through one-time links is automatically deleted after access or
                expiration.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                You may request deletion of your account and associated metadata (e.g., usage logs, subscription info)
                at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@viewonce.com">privacy@viewonce.com</a>.
                ViewOnce does not retain messages or files once accessed, so no message content is available for export
                or recovery.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Any material changes will be communicated via the
                website or email. Continued use of the platform constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
            </p>
